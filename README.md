TennisGame is an application to display current score of a tennis game. 
The application will start showing an empty game, and the user will be able to add a point to a player, showing the resulting score.

The application consists of a very simple HTML client and a server:

  1. [The Client](https://github.com/mean-develpr/TennisGame/blob/master/TennisGameClient/README.md): containing HTML/JS/CSS files.
  1. [The Server](https://github.com/mean-develpr/TennisGame/blob/master/TennisGameServer/README.md): implemented with Grails.
 

Follow instructions in each section to start the server & client.
